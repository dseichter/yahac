You can configure as much as needed sensors and switches. As soon as you show the menu (right click on the yahac icon), the latest value of your entities will be collected and shown.

**!!! There is a false positive alert after downloading the windows binary [#34](https://github.com/dseichter/yahac/issues/34). Exclude this file from your Windows Defender. I am working on it. !!!**

## Start yahac

You won't see any window appear, because yahac starts only as tray icon in your task bar. Follow the [installation instruction](installation.md) if you start yahac the first time.
