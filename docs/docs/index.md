## Known issues

### Windows Defender 
There is a false positive alert after downloading the windows binary [#34](https://github.com/dseichter/yahac/issues/34). Exclude this file from your Windows Defender. I am working on it.

### GNOME
GNOME does not support Tray Menu out of the box. There are serveral solutions to enable a tray menu within GNOME. I can't recommend any of them at the moment.
