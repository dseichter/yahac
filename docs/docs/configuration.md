# Configuration

The configuration of yahac is really simple. Therefore most of the settings are already done, after you started the application the first time.

## Option

**Important**: after changing the host or token, you need to restart the application.

### URL

This is the url you reach your Home Assistant instance. Just copy and paste it from your browser.

### Token

The token, you have created can be added/shown here.

### Update on startup

Let yahac check during startup, of there is an update (never release on GitHub) available.

### Autostart application

If you wish, that yahac will start automatically after you have logged in to your computer, you can set this option to true.

### Ask for confirmation

This option is only relevant for switches. If you want to change the state of a switch, you should be sometimes careful. Therefore, default true, this option will enable a small confirmation dialog, as soon as you click on the entry.

## MQTT

You can register yahac as a MQTT device within your Home Assistant system.

### Register yahac as MQTT

If this checkbox is set, please be sure, you have filled out all the entries below.

### MQTT Host

Your DNS name or IP address of your MQTT broker.

### MQTT Port

The port, your service is listening.

### MQTT User

Username for mqtt. To increase security, you can create a new user within your MQTT.

### MQTT Password

Last but not least, provide the password.

## Logging

yahac writes per default the logs to /tmp/yahac.log. Since there are no sensitive data, the temp file is available within all operating systems, I kept this approach.

### Loglevel

Specify your loglevel, you want to run yahac. At the beginning, you might see potential configuration issues, so I recommend to set to **INFO**.
Default is **ERROR**.
