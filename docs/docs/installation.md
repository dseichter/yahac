# Installation

yahac itself does not need any additional libraries or components intstalled on your computer. Download the latest releases, place it into a directory of your choice and start.

## First time

If you start yahac the first time, it will create within your users directory a subfolder `.yahac` and also creates the configuration file `config.json`.

You will be asked to provide your URL and a token, which are needed to communication with your Home Assistant instance.

The token can be generated by opening your profile in Home Assistant, switch to security and scroll down to the long live access tokens.

More configuration is not needed to be able to proceed.

Now you can choose to proceed with adding your first [sensors](sensors.md) or make further [configuration](configuration.md).
